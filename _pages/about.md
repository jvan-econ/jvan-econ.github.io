I’m an applied microeconomist focused on environmental economics, with research interests in environmental justice, non-market valuation, residential sorting, and public goods. My work appears in top journals including PNAS, JEEM, and Southern Economic Journal. I’m an active member of AERE and NAREA and have reviewed for journals such as AJARE and the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics.

Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Bowdoin College, where I teach mid- and upper-level courses in environmental economics. My teaching emphasizes equity and the distributional impacts of policy, with a focus on valuation techniques, environmental justice, and climate change. I have previously designed and taught courses such as Principles of Microeconomics and Introduction to Natural Resource Economics and have frequently guest lectured in graduate courses on econometrics and environmental economics.

From 2023 to 2025, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rhode Island, working with Dr. Corey Lang on a USDA-funded project exploring partisan preferences for environmental goods. I also collaborate with scholars at Loyola University, the University of Maryland, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, The Ohio State University, and the University at Buffalo.
