I am an applied microeconomist specializing in environmental economics. My primary research focuses on the intersection of environmental justice, equity, and land conservation efforts. I am an active researcher in my field and have published in several journals such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* and *Land Economics*. I am a member of the *Association of Environmental and Resource Economists*, and the *Northeastern Agricultural and Resource Economics Association*, and I have served as a referee for the *Australian Journal of Agriculture and Resource Economics*. Additional research interests include urban economics, mobility and residential sorting, public goods, voting, and non-market valuation.

Currently, I work at the University of Rhode Island with Dr. Corey Lang as a postdoctoral researcher. We are investigating partisan preferences for environmental goods as part of a *USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture* grant. I am constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate on research with peers across all fields. I have conducted successful research projects with faculty from *The Ohio State University*, and have current projects with faculty from *Loyola University*.

Aside from my research projects, I also enjoy working with students. I have had the opportunity to design and instruct two undergraduate courses in *Princples of Microeconomics*, and *Introduction to Natural Resource Economics*. Additionally, I have guest lectured for *Econometrics II* and *Environmental Economics* at the graduate level. A future goal of mine would be to develop a graduate course around applied environmental economics and non-market valuation methods.
