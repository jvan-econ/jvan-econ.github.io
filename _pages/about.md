I am an applied microeconomist specializing in environmental economics, with a research focus on environmental justice, non-market valuation, and residential sorting models. My work has been published in leading journals, including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, and Southern Economic Journal. I am an active member of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists and the Northeastern Agricultural and Resource Economics Association, and I have served as a referee for the Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics. My broader research interests include public goods, voting, and urban economics.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students. During my graduate studies, I designed and instructed Principles of Microeconomics and Introduction to Natural Resource Economics, integrating discussions on equity and the distributional impacts of economic policy. I have also guest lectured in Advanced Econometrics and Environmental Economics at the graduate level.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rhode Island, working with Dr. Corey Lang on a USDA-funded study examining partisan preferences for environmental goods. I actively collaborate across disciplines and institutions, with ongoing projects alongside faculty at Loyola University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research has also included partnerships with faculty at The Ohio State University.

Beginning in Fall 2025, I will join the Department of Economics at Bowdoin College as a Visiting Assistant Professor, teaching mid- and upper-level courses in environmental economics. My courses will cover core topics in environmental economics, with a particular emphasis on policy valuation, environmental justice, and climate change.
