I am an applied microeconomist specializing in environmental economics. My primary research focuses on the intersection of environmental justice, non-market valuation, and residential sorting models. I am an active researcher in my field and have published in several journals such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* and *Land Economics*. I am a member of the *Association of Environmental and Resource Economists*, and the *Northeastern Agricultural and Resource Economics Association*, and I have served as a referee for the *Australian Journal of Agriculture and Resource Economics* and *Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics*. Additional research interests include public goods, voting, and urban economics.

I also enjoy working with students. I had the opportunity to design and instruct both *Princples of Microeconomics*, and *Introduction to Natural Resource Economics* during my graduate studies. Engaging with students in discussion on the equity implications and distributional impacts of economic policy has been an incredibly rewarding teaching experience. I believe that advising and teaching undergraduates is one of my strengths as a new academic on the job market. I have also guest lectured for *Advanced Econometrics* and *Environmental Economics* at the graduate level. A future goal of mine would be to develop a graduate course around applied environmental economics and non-market valuation methods.

Currently, I work at the University of Rhode Island with Dr. Corey Lang as a postdoctoral researcher. We are investigating partisan preferences for environmental goods as part of a *USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture* grant. I am constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate on research with peers across all fields. I have conducted successful research projects with faculty from *The Ohio State University*, and have current projects with faculty from *Loyola University*, *University of Maryland*, and *University of Wisconsin-Madison*.
