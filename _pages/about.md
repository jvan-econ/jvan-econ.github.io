I’m an applied microeconomist focused on environmental economics, with research interests in environmental justice, non-market valuation, climate adaptation, and  sorting models. My work appears in top journals including *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*, and *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*. I’m an active member of AERE and NAREA and have reviewed for journals such as AJARE and the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics.

Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Bowdoin College, where I teach mid- and upper-level courses in environmental economics. My teaching emphasizes equity and the distributional impacts of environmental policy, with a focus on environmental justice, climate change adaptation, and data analysis.I am passionate about mentoring undergraduate students through hands-on research. My courses regularly integrate programming (R or Stata) and GIS for the analysis of economic and environmental data.

From 2023 to 2025, I served as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Rhode Island on a USDA-funded project with Dr. Corey Lang, exploring partisan support for climate change policy and environmental goods. I also collaborate with scholars at Loyola University, the University of Maryland, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, The Ohio State University, and Bowdoin College.
