I am an applied microeconomist specializing in environmental economics. My primary research focuses on the intersection of environmental justice, equity, and land conservation efforts. I am an active researcher in my field and have published in several journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Land Economics. Additional research interests include urban economics, mobility and residential sorting, public goods, voting, and non-market valuation.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rhode Island. Currently, I work with Dr. Corey Lang on partisan preferences for farm, forest, and open space lands under a USDA NIFA grant.
I have had the opportunity to teach two under graduate courses in microeconomics and resource economics, and I have guest lectured econometrics and environmental economics at the graduate level. I am constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate with research partners across all fields as applied economics continues to evolve and expand into new areas.
