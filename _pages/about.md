I am an applied microeconomist specializing in environmental economics, with a research focus on environmental justice, non-market valuation, and residential sorting models. My work has been published in leading journals, including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Land Economics. I am an active member of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists and the Northeastern Agricultural and Resource Economics Association and have served as a referee for the Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics. My broader research interests include public goods, voting, and urban economics.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students. During my graduate studies, I designed and instructed Principles of Microeconomics and Introduction to Natural Resource Economics, fostering discussions on the equity and distributional impacts of economic policy. I have also guest lectured in Advanced Econometrics and Environmental Economics at the graduate level. In the future, I hope to develop a graduate course on applied environmental economics and non-market valuation methods.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rhode Island, working with Dr. Corey Lang on a USDA-funded study examining partisan preferences for environmental goods. I actively collaborate across disciplines and institutions, with ongoing projects alongside faculty at Loyola University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research has also included partnerships with faculty at The Ohio State University.
